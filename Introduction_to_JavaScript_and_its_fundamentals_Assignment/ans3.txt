Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
ANSWER

1. Number: The number data type represents numeric values. It includes integers, floating-point numbers, and special numeric values like Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (Not-a-Number).

Example:
let x = 10;        // integer
let y = 3.14;      // floating-point number
let z = Infinity;  // special numeric value

2.String: The string data type represents textual data, enclosed within single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

Example: 
let name = 'John';     // using single quotes
let message = "Hello"; // using double quotes

3. Boolean: The boolean data type represents a logical value indicating true or false.

Example:
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;


4. Undefined: The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It also represents the value of a function that does not return any value explicitly.

Example:
let variable; // variable is declared but not assigned a value, so it's undefined
function greet() {
    // no return statement, so the function returns undefined
}


5. Null: The null data type represents the intentional absence of any value or object. It is used to indicate that a variable has been explicitly assigned "nothing".

Example:
let car = null; // car variable intentionally has no value
