Question- Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
Ans-  Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. The number of operands an operator takes determines its arity. Here are the different types of operators based on arity:

1. Unary Operators:

Unary operators work with only one operand.
Examples include the increment (++), decrement (--), and logical NOT (!) operators.
Example:
// Unary increment operator
let a = 5;
let b = ++a;  // Increment 'a' before using its value
console.log(a);  // Output: 6
console.log(b);  // Output: 6

// Unary logical NOT operator
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = !isTrue;
console.log(isFalse);  // Output: false


2. Binary Operators:

Binary operators work with two operands.
Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), assignment operators (=), and comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==).

emample: 
// Binary arithmetic operator
let sum = 10 + 5;
console.log(sum);
  // Output: 15


3. Ternary Operator:

The ternary operator is the only ternary operator in JavaScript, and it's a shorthand for an if-else statement.
It takes three operands: a condition, an expression to execute if the condition is true, and an expression to execute if the condition is false.

emample:  

// Ternary operator
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
console.log(status);  
// Output: 'Adult'
