Q2 . Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for 
each category.

Solution:  Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality. Here are the main categories:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
Perform basic mathematical operations.
 sum = 5 + 3;    // Addition
 difference = 7 - 2; // Subtraction
 product = 4 * 6; // Multiplication
 quotient = 8 / 2; // Division
 remainder = 10 % 3; // Modulus (remainder of division)

2. Comparison Operators:
Compare two values and return a Boolean result.
 isEqual = (5 == "5");      // Equality (loose)
 isStrictEqual = (5 === 5); // Strict Equality
 isNotEqual = (10 != 8);    // Inequality (loose)
 isGreaterThan = (15 > 10); // Greater than
 isLessThanOrEqual = (20 <= 25); // Less than or equal to

3. Logical Operators:
Perform logical operations on Boolean values.
 andResult = (true && false);  // Logical AND
 orResult = (true || false);   // Logical OR
 notResult = !true;            // Logical NOT

4. Assignment Operators:
Assign values to variables.
 x = 10;     // Basic assignment
x += 5;         // Addition assignment (x = x + 5)

5. Increment/Decrement Operators:
Increase or decrease the value of a variable.
 count = 5;
count++;        // Increment by 1
count--;        // Decrement by 1

6. Bitwise Operators:
Manipulate individual bits in binary numbers.
 bitAnd = 5 & 3;  // Bitwise AND
 bitOr = 5 | 3;   // Bitwise OR
 bitXor = 5 ^ 3;  // Bitwise XOR
