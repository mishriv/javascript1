Question  : Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

Ans:  
- precedence
Precedence determines the order of evaluation when multiple operators are present in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

For example:
let result = 2 + 3 * 4;
console.log(result);  
// Output: 14
(In this case, the multiplication operator (*) has higher precedence than the addition operator (+), so the multiplication is performed first.)

-Associativity
Associativity defines the order of evaluation when operators of the same precedence appear in an expression. It can be either left-to-right or right-to-left.

For example:
let result = 2 + 3 - 1;
console.log(result); 
 // Output: 4
(In this case, both the addition and subtraction operators have the same precedence, and they are left-to-right associative. Therefore, the addition is performed first.)


Comprehending the concepts of precedence and associativity holds significance for several reasons:

1. Ensuring Correct Evaluation 
   - Understanding the order of precedence guarantees accurate evaluation of expressions, thereby preventing potential errors or unexpected results.

2. Facilitating Complex Expressions 
   - When dealing with intricate expressions, awareness of precedence and associativity empowers developers to craft code that behaves as intended. This, in turn, enhances the code's readability and maintainability.

3. Aiding in Debugging 
   - In scenarios where unexpected results occur, knowledge of operator precedence and associativity becomes instrumental in debugging and identifying the root cause of issues.

4. Optimizing Code 
   - Proficiency in precedence and associativity can be leveraged to optimize code by circumventing unnecessary parentheses and ensuring efficient computation. This optimization contributes to code that is both concise and performs well.
