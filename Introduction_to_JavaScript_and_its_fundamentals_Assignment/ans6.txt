Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript. Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
answer:

Choosing meaningful variable names in JavaScript is important for code clarity and understanding. Descriptive identifiers convey the purpose of variables, making the code more self-explanatory and reducing the need for additional comments. 
For example: 

// random variable names
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = x * y;

// Improved with descriptive names
let numberOfItems = 10;
let pricePerItem = 5;
let totalCost = numberOfItems * pricePerItem;
